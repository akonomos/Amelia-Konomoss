Hello world, i'm Amelia

# About me



:dizzy: To express my love for physics, I will resort to a few words. "Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think". <br />
:dizzy: I am a recent graduate of UCLA with a B.S. in Astrophysics. <br />
:dizzy: I am a curious and passionate problem-solver who enjoys using numbers and data to tell a story. <br />

# Physics and Astronomy

:boom: Physics and astronomy go hand in hand. As a summer research fellow at Caltech, I explored atmospheric characterization of exoplanets. Read about my project below! <br />

# Physics and Computer Science
:boom: Physics and computer science are two complimentary fields. The former provides an analytical framework about the natural world while the latter applies practical insights to data science.  <br />
:boom: Some of my coding projects include an Exoplanet Wavelength Calibrated Solution Framework (Python) and Reference Frame Shift Code (Python). I am interested in further applying machine learning and quantum computing to physics and data science. <br /> 
:boom: With my research, I use the pre-written NIRSPEC Data Reduction Pipeline to run analysis of science images. The projects mentioned above were used to create wavelength solutions and a transit graph of wavelength and flux:

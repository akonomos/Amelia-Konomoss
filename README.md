:dizzy: To express my love for physics, I will resort to a few words. "Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think". <br />
:dizzy: I am a third year undergraduate at UCLA majoring in Astrophysics. <br />
:dizzy:  I have explored broad research interests, ranging from planetary formation to neural networks. I am interested in applying physics to new technologies and industries, as I believe it is a powerful language once fluent. <br />
:dizzy:  I use analytical, statistical, and computational methods to study these areas and share my knowledge.  <br />

# Physics and Astronomy

:boom: Physics and astronomy compliment each other beautifully. As a summer research fellow at Caltech, I explored atmospheric characterization of exoplanets. Read about my project below! <br />

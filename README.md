:dizzy: To express my love for physics, I will resort to a few words. "Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think". <br />
:dizzy: I am a third year undergraduate at UCLA majoring in Astrophysics. <br />
:dizzy:  I have broad resarch interests, ranging from planetary formation to particle physics. I am interested in applying physics to new technologies and industries, as I believe it is a powerful language to be utilized once one gains fluency. <br />
:dizzy:  I use analytical, statistical, and computational methods to study these areas and share my knowledge.  <br />

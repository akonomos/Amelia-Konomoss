:dizzy: To express my love for physics, I will resort to a few words. "Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think". <br />
:dizzy: I am a third year undergraduate at UCLA majoring in Astrophysics. <br />
:dizzy:  I have explored broad research interests, ranging from planetary formation to neural networks. I am interested in applying physics to new technologies and industries, as I believe it is a powerful language once fluent. <br />
:dizzy:  I use analytical, statistical, and computational methods to study these areas and share my knowledge.  <br />

# Physics and Astronomy

:boom: Physics and astronomy go hand in hand. As a summer research fellow at Caltech, I explored atmospheric characterization of exoplanets. Read about my project below! <br />

# Physics and Computer Science
Physics and computer science are two complimentary fields. The former provides an analytical framework about the natural world while the latter applies practical insights to data science. Through my studies, I have gained experience with both Python and C++ and libraries like AstroPy, NumPy, pandas, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.  <br />
Some of my coding projects include an Exoplanet Wavelength Calibrated Solution Framework (Python) and Reference Frame Shift Code (Python). I am interested in further applying machine learning to physics and data science.
